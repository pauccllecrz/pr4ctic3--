        <h2>Types of Galaxies:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Spiral</h3></li><img src="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/wp-content/uploads/M51-Spiral-Galaxu-252x380.jpg" alt="Spiral Galaxy credits to NASA" class="center"><dd>Spiral galaxies can be recognized by their wide, flat disks of rotating gas and dust.</dd>
            <li><h3>Elliptical</h3></li><img src="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/wp-content/uploads/Elliptical-Galaxy-NGC-1132-453x435.jpg" alt="Elliptical Galaxy credits to NASA" class="center"><dd>Elliptical galaxies are oblong shape and lack of overall structure. Some are nearly spherical, while others shaped like a cigar. They can range in size from just a few light years across to being larger than our milky way.</dd>
            <li><h3>Peculiar</h3></li><img src="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Antennae-Galaxies-438x435.jpg" alt="Peculiar Galaxy credits to NASA" class="center"><dd>Peculiar galaxies are almost always the result of one galactic collisions. It is believed that peculiar galaxies are composed of 5-10% of all known galaxies.</dd>
            <li><h3>Irregular</h3></li><img src="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/wp-content/uploads/585433main_supernova_1987_946-710-397x298.jpg" alt="Irregular Galaxy credits to NASA" class="center"><dd>These galaxies tend to be smaller, dwarf galaxies that lack any distinguishable shape.</dd>
